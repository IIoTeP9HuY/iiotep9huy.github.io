My name is Andrei Kashin, and I'm currently working on core research
infrastructure at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com).
Prior to coming here I developed distributed computation
platform [YT](https://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/311104/) at [Yandex](https://yandex.com/).
At the same time I studied and teached courses at
[Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en)
and [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://yandexdataschool.com/) in Moscow.
