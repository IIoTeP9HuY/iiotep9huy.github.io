My name is Andrei Kashin, and I'm currently working on core research
infrastructure at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com).
Prior to coming here I developed distributed computation
platform [YT](https://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/311104/) at [Yandex](https://yandex.com/).
At the same time I studied and teached courses at
[Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en)
and [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://yandexdataschool.com/) in Moscow.

In my free time I enjoy online coding competitions,
ranging from standard algorithmic contests like [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)
and spanning all the way to marathons for developing AI for games
([Deadline24](https://www.deadline24.pl/), [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/))
and [Wargames](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) for finding security breaches in crypto protocols.

Apart from that, I am a keen [traveller](https://www.amcharts.com/visited_countries/#AT,BY,CZ,FR,DE,HU,NL,PL,RU,CH,UA,GB,US,IN,TH),
love [running](http://www.runcity.org/en/events/) and playing board games.
